*Summer 2K23 Update:*
I've been spending most of my free time building a 3D game in C# and Unity, hence the lack of commit history lately.

- 👋 Hi, I’m Max!
- 👀 I’m interested in VR/AR, AI, accessibility, music/sound design, and games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning linear algebra and how to play drums
- 💞️ I like collaborating on fun, snappy projects where I can learn something new!
